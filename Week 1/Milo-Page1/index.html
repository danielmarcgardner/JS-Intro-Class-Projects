<h1> About me</h1>
<p> Hi my name is Milo and I am an English Bulldog. I was born on November 24, 2014 in Atwater, CA.
  As a young pup I was very adventurous and I caused lots of trouble with my littermates.
  My dad adopted me at 6 months old and we moved to San Francisco where I have had
  many fun adventures and met many friends. My favorite activities include: eating, sleeping,
  playing with friends, biting fluffy tails, thinking I can swim, getting dirty,and playing ball.
  I am also a member of JFCS's Canine Corps working as a therapy dog making
  friendly visits to seniors and others in need of a dog visit.</p>
